	<p>My name is Jhon Keneth Ryan B. Namias, I am enrolled in YASC studying Information and Communications Technology. This is my Performance Task 1 & 2 in computer system servicing and computer programming.</p>
	<p>This Performance Task 1 & 2 in Computer Programming and Computer System Servicing was assigned as a individual activity. The objective of this website is to minimize the difficulties of people by providing them daily needs simply. At Namias people can simply find their desired item and order it. You are provided both choices of "cash on delivery" as well as "Online payment" which you can choose according to your simplicity. We've created an initial prototype of the website. Also, I planned this website to be a clone of Lazada Shop but It's too complicated and I don't have enough time to do that.</p>
